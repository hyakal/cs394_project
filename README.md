**Weather Application** üå¶Ô∏è

This is a weather forecast application built using Android Studio and Kotlin, with Firebase integrated for user authentication and data storage. The app provides users with localized and real-time weather updates.

**Overview**

The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API (or another weather service) to fetch weather data. Firebase is utilized for managing user authentication (login and registration) and storing user-related settings or data securely. The app is designed with a clean and user-friendly interface to enhance the user experience.

**Key Features**

**Real-time Weather Data:** Displays current weather conditions for the user's location.
**User Authentication:** Users can sign up or log in via Firebase.
**Multi-day Forecast:** Provides a detailed weather forecast for the week.
**Localization:** Detects and adapts to the user's device language and region.
**Dark Mode Compatibility:** Matches the user's device theme for better usability.

**Technologies Used**

**Kotlin:** Primary programming language for Android development.

**Android Studio:**IDE used for building the application.

**Firebase:** Backend services including:

Authentication for secure user sign-in.

Realtime Database for saving user preferences or historical data.

**Weather API:** Integration for fetching live weather updates.

**How It Works**

**User Authentication:**

Users sign up or log in using Firebase Authentication.
Their preferences or past searches can be stored in Firebase Realtime Database.

**Weather Updates:**

The app fetches weather data from a weather API based on the user‚Äôs location or a searched location.
Displays data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecast.

**User Experience:**

Adapts to the user's language and region automatically.
Supports dark and light mode for a better visual experience.
This application is a great project for learning Kotlin, Android development, and Firebase integration while creating a practical, user-friendly app.
